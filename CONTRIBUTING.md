# First step : IDE
The first step for developing anything, whether its contributing to **Paper world** or making your own game is to find out which environment you want to develop in. Seeing as this is a Java game, we will go ahead and use that IDE. You can download that IDE from [here](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).
You can install it using the default settings it provides for you. Feel free to change the look and feel to suit your needs, or install some plugins if you wish.
